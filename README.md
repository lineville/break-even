# Break Even

Inspired by my grandfather Donald J. Neville (1930-2019) who loved to play Blackjack and would always claim to **break even**. This is a free blackjack game I built for fun with Svelte and TypeScript to explore svelte animations and implement basic strategy hints. You can play using the web interface, WASD, or arrow keys.
